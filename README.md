Python Simulated Social Network:

I am designing a social network which will simulate a network with real users, in order to better understand habits and trends.

Initially, I will populate the network with an amount of people dictated by initial input. These users will be randomly assigned friends within the network, based on their outgoing and friendly traits.

From here, the user can use a number of commands, available through "?" or "help" commands.
